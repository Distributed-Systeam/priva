- No centralized server
- Distributed hash table to keep node information
- States:
	- Number of neighbor nodes
	- Chat history
	- Consensus on threshold value
- Open network, anyone can join
- Kepp track of nodes in network by pulling neighbor node information
- Network can change (neighbor nodes)
	- Direct messaging creates new neighbor if not already
- Threshold value for amount of neighbor nodes
- Language: python (javascript)
- Libary to impelemnt network
	- python-p2p-network (https://github.com/macsnoeren/python-p2p-network)
- Use bootstrap nodes to initialize the p2p network
	- When enough nodes have joined the network, these bootstrap nodes can be removed
